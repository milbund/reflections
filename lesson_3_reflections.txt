When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Creating a remote repository is essential if what you are working on needs collaboration from other people. This is also a backup of your files and you can also "work anywhere" as long as there is git installed locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is to make sure that you control when you want to do the 'pull'. Also this is useful when the files are worked on by different people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks can be used if you want to create a github copy of a github repository you don't have rights to modify. Clone is done to make a local copy of a github repository. Branch is used to create a copy that diverges from the main (master) repository, from which changes can be merged back to the main(master) repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Keeping track of the last known state helps in merging conflicts in commits in the local and remote repositories since this will be the common state to determine the divergence betwen local and remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We can use Office 365 or Google Docs. But it would be hard to keep track of the changes that were made and who made the changes. Also, the change is reflected immediately, there's no way to vet the changes.
