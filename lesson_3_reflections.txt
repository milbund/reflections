When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Creating a remote repository is essential if what you are working on needs collaboration from other people. This is also a backup of your files and you can also "work anywhere" as long as there is git installed locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is to make sure that you control when you want to do the 'pull'. Also this is useful when the files are worked on by different people.
